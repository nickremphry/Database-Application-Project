COSC 4120 Database Applications - Final Project

Language: SQL
Software: Oracle APEX

For this course, each student was required to create an operational database following various specs. The database was for the Community Service Organization and used to organize agencies within the database. Given information "gathered from the customer", I created tables that satisfied the needs for each table, and how those tables communicated to each other. On top of being functional and satisfying customer needs, within the APEX application itself I used elements to make a visually pleasing application for the company to use, as well as quality of life functions for users with the appropriate authority to use, such as creating, updating, and deleting objects in various tables (i.e. people, agencies, names, phone numbers, projects, skills, etc.)

Note: Oracle APEX was provided to students during their enrollment in the course. Post passing the course (and in my case, graduating from my program) I no longer have access to log into the software.
